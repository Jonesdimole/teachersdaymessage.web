🎉 Teacher’s Day Greeting Card (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
🌸 Project Overview

This project is a digital greeting card made for Teacher’s Day.
It displays a teacher’s photo, a heartfelt message, and a button that reveals a hidden greeting with floating heart animations.
The design uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and animation.

🧱 Files Included
File Name	Description
index.html	The main structure of the card — contains the image, message, and button.
style.css	Contains all design and layout styles such as colors, fonts, and animations.
script.js	Adds interactivity (button click reveals the message and floating hearts).
🎨 Features

✅ Beautiful gradient background
✅ Circular teacher photo
✅ “Happy Teacher’s Day” greeting title
✅ Custom heartfelt message section
✅ Animated floating hearts when the button is clicked
✅ Elegant font style using Playfair Display
✅ Fully responsive — works on different screen sizes

💌 How It Works

When the page loads, the card appears centered on the screen.

A “CLICK MO PO DADDY BIRD 💌” button is displayed below the message.

When the user clicks the button:

The hidden message (div#message) becomes visible.

Floating hearts (❤️) animate across the card using JavaScript and CSS keyframes.

The result is a heartfelt animated digital card experience.

🖼️ Image Setup

To display your teacher’s photo correctly:

Replace the image path inside the <img> tag in index.html with your actual file path.

<img src="images/teacher.jpg" alt="Teacher Photo">


Make sure your image file is saved in the same folder or an images/ subfolder.

⚠️ Note:
Avoid using local paths like C:\Users\Student User\Desktop\... —
Browsers may block these for security reasons. Instead, place your image in your project folder.

⚙️ How to Run the Project

Create a new folder (e.g., TeachersDayCard).

Save your three files inside it:

index.html

style.css

script.js

Open index.html in your web browser.

Click the button to reveal the message and animation. 🌷
